üéôÔ∏è VoiceGuard: Real-Time Speech Analysis & Moderation
VoiceGuard is a web application built with Django and Google Cloud that provides real-time transcription and moderation of speech to foster respectful communication.

üìñ About The Project
VoiceGuard is designed to create a safer digital environment by analyzing spoken words in near real-time. It accepts audio input, transcribes it using Google Cloud's high-performance streaming API, and then uses a hybrid AI approach to moderate the content. Disrespectful or toxic language is flagged, and a polite alternative is suggested by a generative AI.

The project features two modes: a single-file upload for analyzing pre-recorded audio and a high-performance real-time mode for live conversations.

Key Features
High-Performance Real-Time Transcription using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text.

Intelligent Content Moderation with a hybrid approach:

Fast, initial screening using Google's Perspective API.

Creative, rephrased suggestions for flagged content using Google's Gemini API.

Single-File Analysis for uploaded or browser-recorded audio.

Asynchronous Backend built with Django Channels and Daphne for handling concurrent WebSocket connections.

Clean, Interactive UI for displaying live results and moderation alerts.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture
This project uses a modern, production-grade architecture that separates transcription from moderation for maximum performance.

Backend: Django, Django Channels, Daphne

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

Speech-to-Text: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text (Streaming API)

Moderation: Google Perspective API, Google Gemini API

Database: SQLite (for development)
